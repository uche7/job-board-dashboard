# Technologies Used
1. Frontend:

 Next.js (React framework)

 Material UI (Component library)

 TailwindCSS (Utility-first CSS framework)

 TypeScript (Static typing)

 React Hook Form (Form management)

 Yup (Form validation)

 Framer Motion (Animations)

 React Toastify (Notifications)

2. State Management:

 React Context API (Theme management)

3. API:

 Remotive API (Job listings)

# Theme Persistence
The application features a light/dark mode toggle that persists across page reloads and sessions. The theme preference is stored in localStorage and automatically applied to all pages and components.

# How It Works
1. Theme Context:

 The ThemeContext manages the current theme (light or dark).

 The theme is persisted in localStorage and retrieved on page load.

2. Material UI Integration:

 The theme is passed to Material UI's ThemeProvider, ensuring all MUI components adapt to the current theme.

3. Custom Styling:

 TailwindCSS classes and custom styles are dynamically applied based on the current theme.

# Additional Features
# Job Application Form

1. Fields:

 Full Name

 Email Address (with validation)

 Resume Upload (PDF/DOC)

 Cover Letter (optional)

2. Validation:

 Real-time validation using Yup schema.

 Error messages for invalid inputs.

3. Submission:

 Form data is logged to the console.

 Success toast notification on submission.

# Pagination
 Jobs are paginated with 20 items per page.

 Users can navigate between pages using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

# Responsive Design
 Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

 Uses TailwindCSS's responsive utilities for layout adjustments.

# Acknowledgments
